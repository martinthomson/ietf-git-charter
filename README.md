Many IETF working groups use external code repository services, primarily
[GitHub](https://github.com/), in managing their work.  Individual working
groups, while continuing to operate within IETF guidelines for working group
activity, have developed their own policies and practices for how they use these
services.  These policies and practices cover aspects such as: managing
discussion between working group mailing lists and GitHub issues and pull
requests; how text contributions are expected to be made; labeling and naming
conventions; maintaining readable draft snapshots; using tooling and automation;
informing participants about IETF policies; and others.

The GitHub Integration and Tooling (GIT) working group will select a set of such
practices and document policies that support those practices.  The policies will
each detail how work is conducted by working groups that opt to follow the work
practice.  The goal is to provide both process and tooling support for working
groups that choose to adopt the practices.

The documents will not alter the Internet Standards Process (BCP 9), they will
describe how to work within it.  Whether working groups choose to use GitHub to
support their work will remain entirely at their discretion.

The working group may also discuss tooling requirements in support of GitHub
use. Decisions about implementing specific tooling needs will be undertaken by
the IETF Tools Team in consultation with working group participants and other
interested contributors.
